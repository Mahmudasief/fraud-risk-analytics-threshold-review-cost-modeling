# Fraud Risk Analytics: Threshold Optimization & Review Cost Modeling

## Business Problem

Fraud detection systems generate high volumes of alerts. Reviewing every alert increases operational cost and investigator workload, while ignoring alerts increases fraud losses.

Fraud teams must balance:

- Fraud loss (false negatives)
- False positive workload and customer friction
- Investigator review cost
- Alert volume and operational capacity

This project evaluates how threshold optimization and selective review policies impact total operational cost in fraud monitoring systems.

## Objective

Minimize total operational cost by modeling trade-offs between:

- Fraud loss (false negatives)
- False positive cost
- Human review cost

Total Operational Cost = Fraud Loss + False Positive Cost + Review Cost

This project demonstrates how decision thresholds and review allocation strategies influence investigation workload and fraud capture efficiency.
